# Introduction

The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is a multilateral treaty with the objective to develop national strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. As such, it is often seen as a key document regarding sustainable development.

The CBD has two supplementary agreements, the Cartagena Protocol and Nagoya Protocol. The former deals with international shipments of genetically modified organisms. The latter provides a legal framework for the equitable sharing of benefits of utilization of genetic resources.

While the CBD is a treaty which became effective on 29th December 1993, it lead to establishment of several international bodies that continue to operate. The CBD Secretariat is based in Montreal, Canada and operates under the United Nations Environment Programme.  Its main functions are to organize meetings, draft documents and assist member governments in the implementation of the CBD treaty. In this capacity, it has published a Technical Series note (No. 100) that I will summarize below.

The parties to the CBD have demonstrated interest in the potential impacts of synthetic biology on the goals of the CBD and requested to write a technical note on the subject, which updates a note on the topic published in 2015. The document was peer-reviewed within one month by one individual, seventeen countries, two intergovernmental organizations and twenty-nine other organizations. A total of 2005 comments were received during the process. The technical work underlying the document was supported by grants from the Governments of Austria and the Netherlands.

# The most important takeaways

The over 200 page document comes with a great 13-point summary. I personally found some of those points overlapping or not clear, so I am providing a summary of the points that I found personally the most interesting below. If you find them interesting, you should certainly also check the original summary and potentially the whole document.

  * recognized need to i) better integrate and coordinate governance of synthetic biology and ii) to expand the focus beyond biosafety, human health and the physical environment to include social and ethical impacts taking into account national contexts.
  * new governance methods, integration with social sciences and engagement with involved stakeholders and communities will be required. The framework needs to foster scientific creativity and allow product development to move ahead responsibly.
