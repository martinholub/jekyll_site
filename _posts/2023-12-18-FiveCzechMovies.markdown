Lately, I have been asked about some Czech movie recommendations which made me think what to recommend to people interested in the Czech history, culture and mentality. “Luckily” the Czech history is rich with drama and oppression, which gave breeding ground to great storytelling. Unluckily, much of the Czech cinematography has not been dubbed in English. But hopefully you should able to find these movies with English subtitles online.

Below are five movies I would recommend to anyone who wants to get better understanding of Czech history, culture and mentality.

### Pelíšky – Cozy Dens (1998)

If a Czech festive occasion turned idyllic something would be fishy. In that spirit, Christmas is more likely to be a catastrophe than anything else, as depicted by this dark comedy.

### S tebou mě baví svět - I Enjoy the World with You (1983)

Three middle aged made go on skiing vacation with their children, leaving their wives at home. This surely can’t go wrong, right?

### Samotáři – Loners (2000)

You did not expect to become lighter and more positive as we go right? It’s Czech movies in the end! Samotáři is a dark comedy about young people, for young people, putting their complicated relationships with friends and partners in the center.

### Na samotě u lesa - Seclusion Near a Forest (1976)

Directed by Jan Menzel (also known for [My Sweet Little Village, 1985]( https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090257/?ref_=ttloc_ov)) and written by Jaroslav Smoljak and Zdeněk Svěrák (known for their plays about fictive Czechoslovak multi-talent [Jára Cimrman]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A1ra_Cimrman).

### Hoří, má panenko - The Firemen's Ball (1967)

Another comedy, this time not that dark, directed by Miloš Forman. You know it’s gonna be good because Forman is two-time Oscar winner. He received Oscars in 1975 and 1984 (and was nominated in 1996) for his movies One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (starring Jack Nicholson) and Amadeus (a magical drama about life of Mozart), beating nominees like Woody Allen, Frederico Fellini, and Stanley Kubrick. Really, if you did not know Forman yet, go watch some of his movies, they are iconic. Apart from the two above, I suggest The Hair (a musical about hippie counterculture and anti-war movement), Taking Off (featuring a parodical scene of group of posh parents smoking pot).

It is important to note that the movies on the list that were made before 1993 are Czechoslovak (not Czech). With exception of *S tebou mě baví svět* which was directed by [Marie Poledňáková](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Poled%C5%88%C3%A1kov%C3%A1) the other movies were directed by men (sad but not surprising ratio, given that only three (!) women have ever won an Oscar for directing, all after 2010).

Do you have a favorite movie that you think should be on the list? Have you seen any of the movies and want to share how you liked it? Let me know in the comments below!
