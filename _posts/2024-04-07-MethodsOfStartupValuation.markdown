Pre-revenue start-up valuation needn't be a mystery!  🚀 💲 Here are the three most common start-up pre-money valuation methods:

## 💰 The Scorecard (aka Bill Payne) method 

Starts from average start-up valuation (for comparable stage, industry, size, …), and multiples it by a subjective weighted factor that considers team, timing, size of the opportunity, technology/product (e.g. IP, network effects, …), competitive environment (e.g. barriers to entry), partnerships/sales/rollout, … (and sometimes a bit more)

### An example 🔎:

Pre-revenue startups similar to startup A are valued on average at \$1.86M. We subjectively assign the following weights (must sum up to 100%) to the following factors: team (35%), timing & size of the opportunity (25%), technology/product (20%), competitive environment (10%), partnerships (10%).

We then score the startup on these metrics relative to the industry average:  team (140%), timing & size of the opportunity (150%), technology/product (89%), competitive environment (67%), partnerships (81%).

Weighting these scores and summing up, we obtain a multiplier for the pre-money valuation relative to industry average: 140%\*35% + 150%\*25% + 89%\*20% + 67%\*10% + 81%\*10% = 1.191. Finally, the pre-money valuation for this startup is: 1.86\*1.191 = \$2.215M.

|                         | Weights | Score | Weights \* Score |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ----- | ---------------- |
| Team                    | .35     | 1.40  | .35\*1.40=.49    |
| Timing & Opportunity    | .25     | 1.50  | .25\*1.50=.375    |
| Technology              | .20     | .89   | .20\*.89=.178    |
| Competitive Environment | .10     | .67   | .10\*.67=.067    |
| Partnerships            | .10     | .81   | .10\*.81=.081    |
| **Total**               | **1.0**     |       | **1.191**        |

## 💰 The “VC” method

First determines the post-money valuation as terminal value / expected ROI. The pre-money valuation is then post-money valuation - investment.

### An example 🔎: 

Startup B anticipates exit in 5 years at \$60M (based on current market data and future projections). VCs anticipate an ROI of 15x (this is commonly 10-30x, sometimes up to 100x for early stage investments). The post-money valuation is then 60/15 = \$4M. Given a sought investment of \$1M, the pre-money valuation of this startup is \$3M.

## 💰 The Berkus method

Assigns value between 0 and \$500k for the following five factors: team, idea, working prototype, board/strategic relationships/partnerships, rollout/sales.

### An example 🔎: 

Startup C has a very good and fast team (\$400k), compelling idea (\$300k), working prototype and a demo (\$500k), has not established marketing/supplier relationships, but has sound board ($250k), and has not rolled out a product or receive first sale yet (\$0). The pre-money valuation of this startup is 0.4 + 0.3 + 0.5 + 0.25 = \$1.45M.
