During my masters at [ETH Zürich](), for about two years, I worked as a student research assistant in the group of Bruno Weber - the [Experimental Imaging & Neuroenergetics](https://www.pharma.uzh.ch/en/research/functionalimaging.html) group at the [Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology](https://www.pharma.uzh.ch/en.html) at the [UZH](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html). It was my first foray into neuroscience, and since then my appreciation for the field, and my interest in it, only grew.

I am absolutely fascinated by the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying complex human behavioral patterns and emotional states. My current work does not leave time to delve into this area deeper, but I hope to be able to do so again in the future.
