### about this site
<br/>
Hello! Welcome on my personal site. At this moment, it is divided into two sections <a href="/" target="blank">blog</a> and <a href="/portfolio" target="blank">projects</a>. In the former you will find my perspectives on life, studies and work in Switzerland. Whereas in the latter I will provide you with more thorough description of my project work at the university. This section is still under construction. Please be patient.
 
There are several reasons why I decided to set up this website. The main one is my friends. I cherish them and absolutely want to stay in touch. And as I am lucky to have friends of various nationalities, I chose to write this blog in English so that anybody can read it. Other important reason for the existence of this site is that I am aware that only few people get an opportunity to study at one of the world leading universities. I did and I am grateful for it. I feel want to share my experiences so that others can see if there are any sharp contrasts between their institutions and ETH. Same goes for life in their countries and in Switzerland. In doing so, I hope to help to discover points for improvement on both sides.

If you have any comments or suggestions regarding the contents or appearance of this site, don’t hesitate to <a href="mailto:martin-holub@outlook.com">share your opinions with me</a>. I will be glad to hear them. Thank you!
