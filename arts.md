I regularly challenge my creativity by picking up odd artsy projects. I have screen-printed some t-shirts and tote bags, drawn posters and wrote some verses in the past. The whole struggle of going from an idea to a final piece is something I find worthwhile and I especially enjoy sharing the process with others as I believe it is an excellent way how to strengthen friendships. At the moment I am also finally starting to learn to play guitar. Besides that, I have also been collecting quotes that move me in some way for few years now, at the moment I have around 600 of them. In early 2022 I have gotten interested in comedy and slowly started collecting funny phrases and punchlines. At the moment it is just something I like to do but down the road I would like share these interests and product thereof with others in some way!
