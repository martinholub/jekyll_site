Hi and welcome!


My name is Martin and I am an engineer turned scientist, trained broadly across wet and dry labs. At the moment I am wrapping up my PhD in the group of [Cees Dekker](https://ceesdekkerlab.nl/) at the [Kavli Institute of Nanoscience](http://kavli.tudelft.nl/) where I have co-developed a new microfluidics assays for single-molecule biophysics experiments and whole-chromosome reconstitution.


During my PhD, I was funded by [EMBO](https://www.embo.org/) to work with [Patrick Cai](https://www.cailab.org/) in synthetic genomics. Working with [iGEM](https://www.igem.org/) and [BlueDot Impact](https://bluedot.org/), I also helped conceptualize and execute research in biosecurity. Prior to my PhD, I worked in bioinformatics in a spin-off that got later acquired by [immunai](https://www.immunai.com/), as well as a researcher in image data analysis in an experimental neuroscience [lab](https://www.brunoweberlab.ch/) focusing on brain energy metabolism.


Besides academic work, I am passionate about educating and empowering biotech trainees. I contribute in this area by supervising iGEM teams and developing open source educational resources with [iGEM Foundation](https://igem.org/). Recently, I also co-founded and co-lead [Nucleate](https://www.nucleate.xyz/) Netherlands, a regional branch of the largest trainee-led biotech nonprofit. Here, it is our mission to build a thriving community of early career researchers in biotechnology and give them the courage and resources they need to endeavor on entrepreneurial journeys.

I got my Masters’ from <a href="http://www.ethz.ch/en/" target="blank">ETH Zürich</a> where, in brief breaks from indulging on copious amounts of molten cheese, I worked on things as diverse as [neuroscience, bioinformatics, tissue engineering, scanning probe microscopy and internet of things](/research/). My Eastern-European accent, as well as love for any meal that contains an unreasonable amount of [potatoes](https://www.wired.com/story/potatoes-are-the-perfect-vegetable-but-youre-eating-them-wrong/), is from the Czech Republic where I was born and raised. My Bachelor’s is then from <a href="https://www.vutbr.cz/en/" target="blank"> Brno University of Technology (BUT)</a> where I worked on biosensors and microfluidics.
