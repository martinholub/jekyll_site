Hi and welcome!

I am Martin and I am passionate about making engineering with biology more accessible for everyone and about using cells to do useful stuff.
As a grad student at [Department of Bionanoscience](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/faculty-of-applied-sciences/about-faculty/departments/bionanoscience/) at the [Kavli Institute of Nanoscience](http://kavli.tudelft.nl/) in Delft (The Netherlands) I peek into bacterial cells to figure out how they pack their DNA. Besides, I am involved with the [iGEM Foundation]( https://igem.org/) as a member of [Engineering Committee](https://2022.igem.org/Engineering/Committee) and the [Governance and Policy steering group](https://after.igem.org/steering-groups/policy).

I got my Masters’ from <a href="http://www.ethz.ch/en/" target="blank">ETH Zürich</a> where, in brief breaks from indulging on copious amounts of molten cheese, I worked on things as diverse as neuroscience, bioinformatics, tissue engineering, scanning probe microscopy and internet of things.


My Eastern-European accent, as well as love for any meal that contains way too much potatoes, is from the Czech Republic where I was born and raised. My Bachelor’s is then from <a href="https://www.vutbr.cz/en/" target="blank"> Brno University of Technology (BUT)</a> where I worked on biosensors and microfluidics.


Aside form my career in science, I enjoy using different languages I know at some level (there is six of them by now), getting into my body and being active (mainly through [calisthenics](/fitness/) and [longboarding](/longboard/)), and picking up [odd artsy project](/arts/).
