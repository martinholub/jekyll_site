### about me
<img class="col one left" src="/img/prof_pic.png">
<br/>
My name is Martin Holub and I grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8Cesk%C3%A9_Bud%C4%9Bjovice" target="blank">Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic</a>.

As engineer trained in physics and biology, my interest lies in developing instruments and techniques that enable discovery and control in cell and molecular biology. I believe that synthetic biology and bioengineering offer an opportunituy for more sustainable future of humanity on this or any other planet. The to-date applications are, however, limited by our inability to image intracellular porcesses at relevant spatio-temporal scales. My mission is to change this.

I am enrolled in Master's program at <a href="http://www.ethz.ch/en/" target="blank">ETH Zürich</a> where I specialize in Bioengineering. Currently, I work on my thesis in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_ion-conductance_microscopy" target="blank">Scanning Ion Conductance Microscopy</a> with <a href="http://www.lbb.ethz.ch/the-group/principal-investigator/D_Momotenko-CV.html" target="blank"> Dr. Dmitry Momotenko </a> at the <a href="http://www.lbb.ethz.ch/" target="blank">Laboratory of Biosensors and Bioelectronics</a>.

Previously, I was an intern in bioinformatics with <a href="https://nebion.com/ne/" target="blank">NEBION</a> where I worked on analysis of big biological datasets from micro-array and next-generation sequencing experiments. Before that, I was with the <a href="https://www.pharma.uzh.ch/en/research/functionalimaging.html" target="blank">Experimental Imaging and Neuroenergetics Lab</a> where I worked on <a href = "https://github.com/EIN-lab/CHIPS">analysis of data from 2-photon fluorescence microscopy</a> and calibration of novel chemical probe for <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/pdfExtended/S1550-4131(18)30759-9" target="blank"> longitudinal oxygen-imaging of deep brain tissue</a>. Before this, I was with the <a href="http://www.cartilage.ethz.ch/" target="blank">Tissue Engineering and Biofabrication Laboratory</a> where I worked on bioprinting and hydrogel scaffolds for tissue engineering.

I obtained Bachelor’s degree from <a href="https://www.vutbr.cz/en/" target="blank">Brno University of Technology (BUT)</a> with the thesis <a href="https://www.vutbr.cz/en/students/final-thesis?action=detail&zp_id=92831&hl_klic_slova=0&hl_abstrakt=0&hl_nazev=0&hl_autor=0&str=916&aid_redir=1">Cavitation in Microfluidics</a> under <a href="https://www.vutbr.cz/en/people/pavel-rudolf-2597/zivotopis"> Prof. Pavel Rudolf</a>. During my undergrad at BUT, I worked further with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hyJp9yIAAAAJ&hl=en" target="blank">Prof. Pavel Neuzil</a> on the proof-of-concept for <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b00776" target="blank">point-of-care microfluidic device</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=PI67YCwAAAAJ&hl=de">Dr. Jan Jedelsky</a> on fluid atomization in spray nozzles.

In my spare time, I love to cook, move around, enjoy art, tinker with microcontrollers or work on my bike. I am a dog person but have both a dog and a cat. In past, I was on Czech National Junior Ultimate Frisbee team and I am ready to argue with anobody who deems there may be a better sport than Ultimate.
