> "But O, how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man's eyes!" —WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE

Hi and welcome!

<img class="col one left" src="/img/prof_pic4.jpg">

My name is Martin, and I am a scientist and an engineer who spends most of his time thinking about how to make biology easier and safer to analyze, manipulate and deploy.

I like poetry, flamenco music, fantasy books, botanical gardens, jazz rap, bachata, mountain lakes, walking barefoot, some cocktails, and most soups. I don't like pasta, resort hotels, metal, conceptual art, red wine, whipped cream, having long fingernails and ice-cold drinking water.

Sometimes I [write](/blog) ~~and I keep a [newsletter](/newsletter)~~ (currently inactive).
