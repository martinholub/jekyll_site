Hi and welcome!

I am Martin and I am researcher in the areas of synthetic biology and biosecurity. As a grad student at [Department of Bionanoscience](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/faculty-of-applied-sciences/about-faculty/departments/bionanoscience/) at the [Kavli Institute of Nanoscience](http://kavli.tudelft.nl/) in Delft (The Netherlands) I am developing new methods to reconstitute and study whole chromosomes in microfluidic compartments.

I am a co-Managing Director of Nulceate NL, an emerging chapter of [Nucleate](https://www.nucleate.xyz/), where I work with academic founders to turn their ideas to businesses.

I am involed with the [iGEM Foundation]( https://igem.org/) as a judge and team supervisor and previously acted as member of the [Engineering Committee](https://2022.igem.org/Engineering/Committee) and the [Governance and Policy Steering Group](https://after.igem.org/steering-groups/policy).

I got my Masters’ from <a href="http://www.ethz.ch/en/" target="blank">ETH Zürich</a> where, in brief breaks from indulging on copious amounts of molten cheese, I worked on things as diverse as [neuroscience, bioinformatics, tissue engineering, scanning probe microscopy and internet of things](/research/).


My Eastern-European accent, as well as love for any meal that contains way too much potatoes, is from the Czech Republic where I was born and raised. My Bachelor’s is then from <a href="https://www.vutbr.cz/en/" target="blank"> Brno University of Technology (BUT)</a> where I worked on biosensors and microfluidics.


Aside form being a scientist, I am a 'mover' and enjoy variety of physical activites, especialy if they have a high skill component (at the moment it is bachata, kizomba, acroyoga, ultimate frisbee and longboarding). I love being outdoors and reading, enjoy trying out new recipes and cooking for others, and am often down to dance the night through.


I am available for consulting, reach out via <a href="#contacticon-center">socials</a> or send me an <a href="mailto:mholub.ethz=gmail+com">e-mail</a>.
