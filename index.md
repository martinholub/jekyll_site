Hi and welcome!

I am Martin and I am passionate about making engineering with biology more accessible for everyone and about using cells to do useful stuff.
As a grad student at [Department of Bionanoscience](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/faculty-of-applied-sciences/about-faculty/departments/bionanoscience/) at the [Kavli Institute of Nanoscience](http://kavli.tudelft.nl/) in Delft (The Netherlands) I peek into bacterial cells to figure out how they pack their DNA. Besides, I am involved with the [iGEM Foundation]( https://igem.org/) as a member of [Engineering Committee](https://2022.igem.org/Engineering/Committee) and the [Governance and Policy steering group](https://after.igem.org/steering-groups/policy).

I got my Masters’ from <a href="http://www.ethz.ch/en/" target="blank">ETH Zürich</a> where, in brief breaks from indulging on copious amounts of molten cheese, I worked on things as diverse as neuroscience, bioinformatics, tissue engineering, scanning probe microscopy and internet of things.


My Eastern-European accent, as well as love for any meal that contains way too much potatoes, is from the Czech Republic where I was born and raised. My Bachelor’s is then from <a href="https://www.vutbr.cz/en/" target="blank"> Brno University of Technology (BUT)</a> where I worked on biosensors and microfluidics. 


My friends know me as someone whose palette of hobbies is surpassed in richness only by the variety of words the Dutch have for rain (more than a hundred) which probably explains why I mostly suck at them.
