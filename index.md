Hi and welcome!

<img class="col one left" src="/img/prof_pic4.jpg">

My name is Martin (aka 'JJ'), and I am a scientist and an engineer who spends most of his time thinking about how to make biology easier and safer to manipulate and deploy.

I like poetry, flamenco music, fantasy books, botanical gardnes, jazz rap, dancing, national parks, walking barefoot, some cocktails, and most soups. I don't like pasta, seaside resorts, metal, conceptual art, red wine, flip-flops, having long fingernails and I hate ice-cold drinking water.

I make [silly playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/holubm?si=6ab799de4c914c77). Sometimes I [write](/blog/).
