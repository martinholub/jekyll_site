In early 2022 I started longboarding - mostly right at the interface of freestyle and dancing. I love the excuse it gives me to be outside and enjoy slowly learning new tricks and steps. It is a sport that is prone to causing injuries so I occasionally have to take a break from it (most recently 6 weeks due to strained muscles in my knee as consequence of popping my board into it, really really hard).

I am maintaining a table of tricks I learn or plan to learn, together with videos that show them and some tips. Over time I would like to find way how to share it with others here. Until then, get in touch if you want to go skating!
