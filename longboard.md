In early 2022 I started longboarding - mostly right at the interface of freestyle and dancing. I love the excuse it gives me to be outside and enjoy slowly learning new tricks and steps. Besides that, I am in love with the community - longboarders are varied and fun bunch and I love meeting with them !

I am maintaining a table of tricks I learn or plan to learn, together with videos that show them and some tips. Over time I would like to find way how to share it with others here. Until then, get in touch if you want to go skating!
