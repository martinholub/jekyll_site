title: Czech & Slovak Scientists
---

There is plenty of people that left the former Czechoslovakia to be able to do what they were passionate about. These were mostly intelligent and udnertakign people and many of went to become great scientists. People often do not know where they come from. Below I keep a simple list of some of them that I came across that I extend over time, as I did not find anything similar eslwhere. It is probably bit skewed towards natural and biomedical sciences:).

 * [Dundr, Miroslav](https://www.rosalindfranklin.edu/academics/faculty/mirek-dundr/): Nucleus and chromatin organization
 * [Vilcek, Jan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Vil%C4%8Dek): Interferons and TNF
 * [Pomahac, Bohndan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohdan_Pomaha%C4%8D): Facial surgery
 * [Bazant, Zdenek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zden%C4%9Bk_P._Ba%C5%BEant): Solid mechanics
 * [Svoboda, Karel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_Svoboda_(scientist)): Neuroscentist at Janelia
 * [Jinek, Martin](https://www.bioc.uzh.ch/teaching/study-overview/lecturers/martin-jinek/): CRISPR
 * [Krivanek, Ondrej](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ondrej_Krivanek): Electron-optical instrumentation


 Here are some from further ago, some of which may have been born to Czechoslovak parents outside of the country:

 * [Zeleny, John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Zeleny)
 * [Heyrovsky, Jan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaroslav_Heyrovsk%C3%BD)
 * [Jansky, Jan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Jansk%C3%BD)
 * [Wichtele, Otto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Wichterle)

 And here are some of the most conteporary ones (born after 1989), some of which enjoy the ability to do science in their home country:
