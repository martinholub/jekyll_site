* <a href="http://www2.bio.ku.dk/IDR/" target="blank">IDDomainSpotter</a> helps you identify disordered regions in AA sequence
* Finding publications that address exactly what you are interested in can be tricky. <a href="https://www.wur.nl/en/article/How-to-use-Google-Scholar.htm" target="blank">Knowing how to use Google Scholar</a> and <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/" target="blank">various search operators</a> (also <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en" target="blank">here</a>) will make your life much easier.
* You are already using version control right? Then you will find it useful to set up <a href="https://coderwall.com/p/wkqf9q/local-global-git-config" target="blank">local and global git configurations</a>.
* Sometimes you will feel like wasting some time reading blogs. To make this process somewhat less exhausting, use an RSS feed aggregator. I recommend <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/" target="blank">Inoreader</a>.

### reading and writing
* <a href="https://rxivist.org/" target="blank">RXvisit</a> combines preprints from bioRxiv with data from Twitter to help you find the papers being discussed in your field.

* <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/" target="blank">Overleaf</a> is an online collaborative latex editor.
* I use <a href="https://www.zotero.org/" target="blank">Zotero</a> for managing my refences. It is free, open-source and allows you to define your own location for file storage (i.e. making it practically unlimited).
* Writing a good research grant proposal is not easy. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/how-to-write-a-great-research-proposal/" target="blank">How to write a great research proposal</a> is an attempt to collect together a number of suggestions about what makes a good proposal.

### project management
* I use <a href="https://app.asana.com/" target="blank">Asana</a> to manage my projects and [ZimWiki](https://zim-wiki.org/) to keep detailed track of my work.
