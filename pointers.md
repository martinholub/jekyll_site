# research
Let's kick off with pointers related to my work and research.
## resources

# life
Being in research is overwhelming and often exhausting. I am firmly convinced that keeping a healthy work-life balance and spending time among others and especially those with backgrounds different from yours are crucial in developing yourself as a person and a character, a responsibility that we all have in this world. It also makes the whole life struggle thing much more fun.

## giving
* <a href="https://www.givewell.org/" target="blank">GiveWell<a/>
  * A meta-charity that helps you donate your resources to make the most good
* You have about <a href="https://80000hours.org/" target="blank">80'000 hours</a> of work in your life. Have you spent sufficient time to think how you will use it to leave the word a better place? This online resource will give you fresh and sometimes pretty surprising perspective.

## sports
* I am an active player of Ultimate (frisbee). Yep that's correct, the proper name is just "Ultimate", maybe because it is the best sport ever? Here are some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyOjtn9SxP4" target="blank">shots from the sport at its best</a>.

## art and related

### visual arts
* <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/accidental-renaissance/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=organic" target="blank">Accidental Renaissance<a/>

### music
Here is link to my Spotify profile: {% include spotifyprofile.html id=page.spotifyusername %}

### books
I read a lot, although much less than I would like to :). I maintain a list of books I have read on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/92718688-martin" target="blank">Goodreads</a> and <a href="https://www.cbdb.cz/uzivatel-7140-jj" target="blank">CBDB</a> (in Czech).

### podcasts
I enjoy podcasts where I learn something new or that made me laugh hard. I am still searching for a good way how to share them here. In the meantime, just ask me if you are interested.

### blogging
* I can highly recommend that you start off with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="blank">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="blank">GitHub Pages</a>. It is free and works across platforms.
* <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/" target="blank">iwantmyname</a> is a great hosting service which I have been using more than 4 years and I am very happy. It is a cool company as well.
