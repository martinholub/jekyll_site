I am currently researching the spatio-temporal organizing principles of circular chromosomes as a PhD candidate in the group of [Cees Dekker](https://ceesdekkerlab.nl/) at the [Department of Bionanoscience](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/faculty-of-applied-sciences/about-faculty/departments/bionanoscience/) at the [Kavli Institute of Nanoscience in Delft](http://kavli.tudelft.nl/).

More information and description of student projects to follow soon. In the meantime, you should just drop me an <a href="mailto:mholub.ethz=gmail+com">e-mail</a> if you are interested in my work.
