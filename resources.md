# life

you know, the non-science stuff.

## giving
* <a href="https://www.givewell.org/" target="blank">GiveWell<a/>
  * A meta-charity that helps you donate your resources to make the most good
* You have about <a href="https://80000hours.org/" target="blank">80'000 hours</a> of work in your life. Have you spent sufficient time to think how you will use it to leave the word a better place? This online resource will give you fresh and sometimes pretty surprising perspective.

## sports
* I used to be ab active player of Ultimate (frisbee). Yep that's correct, the proper name is just "Ultimate", maybe because it is the best sport ever? Here are some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyOjtn9SxP4" target="blank">shots from the sport at its best</a>.

## art and related

### books
 I maintain a list of books I have read on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/92718688-martin" target="blank">Goodreads</a>. I am happy for any book recommendations you would like to share!


### blogging
* I started off with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="blank">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="blank">GitHub Pages</a>. It is free and works across platforms. It worked allright couple of years ago but these days there are much better wats. Still works alriht for static pages with little traffic.

* <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/" target="blank">iwantmyname</a> is a great hosting service which I have been using more than 4 years and I am very happy. It is a cool company as well.
